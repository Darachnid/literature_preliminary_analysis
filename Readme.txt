## Project File Structure

This project uses the following folder structure:

### `/data`
Contains all raw and source input data files. Anything used as an input to the analysis lives here.

### `/out`
Stores all outputs generated by scripts in `/src`.

- `/out/tables`  
  Contains output tables in `.csv` format.

- `/out/plots`  
  Contains visual outputs like `.png` or `.jpg` files.

### `/src`
Holds all R scripts used in processing, analysis, and plotting. This is where the core logic of the project lives.
