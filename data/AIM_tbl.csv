Cell Sources,Cell Sources and Cell-line Maintenance,"Laboratory studies that identify, characterise, or extend animal-cell lines for cultivated-meat production. Typical outputs include newly isolated stem-cell sources, protocols that improve cell-line longevity, and methods that ensure stable long-term use."
Safety,Safety and Nutrition,"Laboratory studies that assess how cultivated meat influences human health, food safety, or nutritional quality, or that develop methods to improve those attributes—for example, reducing microbial risk, adjusting fatty-acid profiles, or eliminating allergens."
Performance,Performance Analysis,"Model-based studies (no surveys, interviews, or focus groups) that quantify current or projected environmental, economic, or techno- economic impacts of cultivated meat—for example, life-cycle assessments, cost curves, or SWOT analyses."
Cell Differentiation,Cell Differentiaition and Specialization,This has been merged with process and bioreactors]
Scaffolding,Scaffolding Materials,"Laboratory studies devoted to designing or analysing three-dimensional substrates on which meat cells adhere and grow. Representative work includes biomaterial synthesis, mechanical testing, and scaffold–cell interaction analysis."
Religion,Religious Perspectives,This has been merged with consumer acceptance
Acceptance,Consumer Acceptance,"Empirical studies—experimental, quasi-experimental, or observational—that gather perspectives from present or potential consumers via text or digital-media analysis, surveys, interviews, or focus groups. Their focus is willingness to try, adopt, or pay for cultivated meat and the factors shaping those attitudes."
Education,Education and Outreach,"Observational studies that investigate how cultivated meat is communicated to the public—through news, social media, or outreach strategies—without collecting new human-subject data. Topics often include workforce needs, terminology debates, and communication tactics."
Ethics,Philosophical Assumptions,"Studies that frame cultivated meat through a defined philosophical or theoretical school (e.g., utilitarianism, eco-modernism, critical theory). Their primary objective is conceptual interrogation, not generation of experimental data"
Media,Media and Nutrient Sources,"Laboratory studies that optimise the liquid growth medium—basal nutrients, growth factors, or supplements—required for cell culture. Media composition is the central variable; scaffolds, cell sourcing, and reactor design receive secondary attention."
Stakeholders,Stakeholder Assessment,"Empirical studies that collect views from non-consumer stakeholders—industry scientists, investors, advocacy groups, academics, supply- chain partners—through surveys, interviews, or focus groups. The emphasis is on expectations, concerns, and strategic priorities outside the regulatory sphere."
Process,Process and Bioreactors,"Laboratory studies that integrate multiple inputs (scaffolds, cells, media) to enhance bioreactor architecture or overall production performance—for example, scale-up strategies, novel perfusion systems, or real-time process monitoring."
Review,Literature Review,"Studies that rely solely on previously published, peer-reviewed literature or explicitly label themselves as a review or overview. They introduce no new empirical data, theory, or philosophical analysis."
Regulations,Policy and Regulations,"Empirical or qualitative studies that examine legal and policy dimensions of cultivated meat. Data sources include interviews with legal actors, policy-document analysis, and case-law review; the goal is to map regulatory frameworks and their implications."
